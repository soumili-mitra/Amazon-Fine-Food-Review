# Amazon-Fine-Food-Review
The goal of this work is to develop an automated text-based classification system that can accurately predict the helpfulness of Amazon online customer reviews. The problem considered is to perform a binary classification using the combination of text-based features and machine learning classification algorithms. The binary classes will be defined as - ‘1’ being ‘Helpful’ and ‘0’ being ‘Not helpful’. The helpfulness measure will be determined based on the number of users who voted the review as ‘helpful’.
